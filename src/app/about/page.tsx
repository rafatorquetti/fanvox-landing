            Instead of subscriptions, feeds, or generic content,
            Fanvox focuses on one-to-one requests — video messages,
            private calls, and direct responses created on demand.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Every creator on Fanvox is reviewed and verified.
            Every request is protected.
            If a creator does not deliver, the fan is refunded.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Fanvox is built to respect time, attention, and effort —
            creating a fair exchange for both fans and creators.
